##Vehicle Detection and Counting from Video Streams
#Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting and counting different types of vehicles in video streams. It uses computer vision techniques to first identify vehicles such as buses, cars, rickshaws, and bikes, and then counts each category separately in real time. The system is designed to be efficient, working with video inputs to automate vehicle detection and provide insights into the number of each type of vehicle present.

#Features
Vehicle Detection: Detects various vehicle types, including buses, cars, rickshaws, and bikes.
Vehicle Counting: Separately counts each detected vehicle type in the video.
Real-time Processing: Processes video inputs in real time to deliver immediate results.
Scalable Model: Can be adapted to new vehicle types and integrated into larger traffic management systems.
#Use Cases
Traffic Monitoring: This project can be used for analyzing traffic flows and density in urban areas.
Traffic Management Systems: It can aid city planners and traffic controllers in better managing vehicle congestion.
Data Collection for Research: The project can assist in gathering data for research purposes related to traffic patterns and vehicle usage.
#Requirements
ultralytics
OpenCV
Pre-trained YOLO (You Only Look Once) model
How to Use
Install the required dependencies.
Run the script on your video file or video stream.
The program will output the total number of vehicles detected and the count for each vehicle type (bus, car, rickshaw, bike).
#Future Enhancements
Integration of more vehicle types.
Enhanced accuracy for occluded or partially visible vehicles.
Optimization for faster processing times on larger datasets.
